# python operators
# ARITHMETIC
# -> associativity: left to right
# addition: + 
# subtraction: -
# multiplication: *
# division (float): / => returns a float
# division (floor): // => returns the floor & does not automatically convert to float
# modulus: % returns the remainder

# power: ** not ^ !!! -> associativity: right to left



# COMPARISON
# greater than: > 
# less than: <
# equal: ==
# not equal: !=
# greater than or equal to: >=
# lesser than or equal to: <=

# can be chained then it is true or false logic flow



# LOGICAL
# -> precedence (order): left to right
# and: and
# or: or
# not: not
