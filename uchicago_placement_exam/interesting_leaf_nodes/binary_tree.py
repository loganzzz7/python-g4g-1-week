class BinaryTree:
    '''
    Class for representing binary trees.

    Public attributes:
        value: the value associated with this node represented as an integer
        left: the left child of the node (will be None, if the
            node does not have a left child)
        right: the right child of the node (will be None, if the
            node does not have a right child)
